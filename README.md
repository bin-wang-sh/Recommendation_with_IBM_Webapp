#Recommendations with IBM Project

## 1. Installation
I use python 3.5 to create this project and the main libraries I used are:
- sikit-learn ==0.19.1
- numpy==1.15.0
- pandas==0.23.4

## 2. Project Motivation

For this Udacity project I'm looking at the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. I use several recommendations to shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.
In order to determine which articles to show to each user, I perform a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. I use the following recommendations to recommend articles
- Rank based recommendation
- User based collaborative filtering recommendation
- Content based recommendation
- Matrix Factorization recommendation

The above recommendations are used in the different situations and they are combined a whole solution.
